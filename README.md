  <h3>Analysis:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Highlights the most frequently used and heaviest routes (e.g., Portland → Secaucus).</li>
    <li>Scatter chart shows relationship between shipment weight and freight cost.</li>
    <li>Shipment volume table provides route-level comparisons and density map by state.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How It Helps Allagash:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Helps consolidate or optimize high-cost routes.</li>
    <li>Identifies routes with inefficient cost-to-weight ratio for improvement.</li>
    <li>Supports planning of resource allocation based on route volume.</li>
  </ul>
